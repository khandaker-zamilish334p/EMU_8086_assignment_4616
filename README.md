# EMU_8086_assignment_4616

An assignment given to us batch 20 of IUT EEE. 
needed to implement bubble sort and binary search using intel 8086 assembly because a friend cant carry a notepad but is legend enough to carry an intel 8086 microporcessor kit but dumb enough to programme it. 
just needed to sort a shopping list
